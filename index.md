### Automated Architecture and Hyperparameter Optimization for Deep Neural Networks Applied in Forecasting the Cross-Section of Stock Returns (Master Thesis)

This project explores the application of deep learning techniques to predict the cross-section of stock returns. The focus is on developing and automatically tuning deep neural network models to enhance the accuracy of stock return forecasts. By leveraging advanced machine learning methodologies, the study aims to assess the predictive performance of semi-automated methodologies in the context of asset pricing.

### Whisper AI Transcriber

A lightweight web application that transcribes YouTube videos, podcasts (via URL), and user-uploaded audio files. It leverages OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model for speech-to-text, supporting both local inference and API-based processing. Built to demonstrate practical integration of AI models in web applications and provide a simple, user-friendly interface for transcription tasks.
